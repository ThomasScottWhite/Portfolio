    "### Step 1: Define The Problem\n",
    "- <u> Problem Statement </u>\n",
    "    - Due to frequently changing programing languages, I often have to go back to basic language documentation to relearn what x language looks like.<br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints:\n",
    "    - Must be completed in a week. <br>\n",
    "    - Have at least Python, c#, C++ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Generate Concepts\n",
    "- <u> Brainstorming: </u> <br>\n",
    "    - Programing Language Cheat Sheet: <br>\n",
    "        - A rosetta stone/cheat sheet of basic definitions for each language, include their use cases as well? <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    - Example Projects for each language\n",
    "        - +Gives valuable experience and more would bea better example of use cases for the languages. -Too time consuming<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Develop Solution\n",
    "Due to time constraints and ease of use the programing I chose to implement the cheat sheet / rosetta stone idea. However the cheat sheets will still be in the formatting of the respective programing language and ideally be runnable.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cheat Sheet Minimum Requirements:\n",
    "    - Variables(int, string,booleans,floats,etc) <br>\n",
    "    - Math <br>\n",
    "    - Functions<br>\n",
    "    - If Statements<br>\n",
    "    - For Loops<br>\n",
    "    - While Loops<br>\n",
    "    - Arrays<br>\n",
    "    - Classes/Objects<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Languages (Most to Least important)\n",
    "    - Python Done <br>\n",
    "    - C# Done <br>\n",
    "    - C++ Done  <br>\n",
    "    - Lua skiped <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stretch Goal languages\n",
    "    - HTML <br>\n",
    "    - CSS <br>\n",
    "    - SQL <br>\n",
    "    - Javascript <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Research Required\n",
    "    - Go though the documentation or examples of each coding language <br>\n",
    "    - if there is a enough time, research web development and SQL <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Step 4: Construct and Test Prototype\n",
    "Since python is practically pseudocode, it is the first language I am going to create an example with and base all examples off of.<br>\n",
    "due to length the examples can be found in Resume/Code/Example Code and in Resume/Code/Projects/Project 1 - Rosetta Stone/Example Code <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Evaluate Solution\n",
    "Due to time constrants the project wasn't entirely finished, however the 3 most important languages that were vital were completed. Stretch goal languages are planned to be completed later once more experience is developed in web development."

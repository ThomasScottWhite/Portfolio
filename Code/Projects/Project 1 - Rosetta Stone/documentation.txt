    Step 1: Define The Problem
    Problem Statement   
        Due to frequently changing programing languages, I often have to go back to basic language documentation to relearn what x language looks like.

    Constraints
        Must be completed in a weekend.

    Step 2: Generate Concepts
        Brainstorm:
            Programing Language Cheat Sheet:
                A rosetta stone/cheat sheet of basic definitions for each language, include their use cases as well?
            Example Projects for each language
                +Gives valuable experience and more would bea better example of use cases for the languages. -Too time consuming
    Step 3: Develop Solution
        Due to time constraints and ease of use the programing cheat sheet is the best solution brainstormed. However the cheat sheet will be a runnable command line file
        to give examples of basic inputs and functionality similar to Echo OFF

        List of what needs to be included:
            Variables(int, string,booleans,floats,etc)
            Math
            Functions
            If Statements
            For Loops
            While Loops
            Arrays
            Classes/Objects

        Languages to create a example for (Most to Least important)
            Python, Done
            C#, Done
            C++
            Javascript
            Lua // Skip?
        
        Languages that are way too different to include but may be good to create examples later on
            HTML
            CSS
            SQL
            // Maybe include Javascript here as it is web based

    Step 4: Construct and Test Prototype
        Since python is practically pseudocode, it is the first language I am going to create an example with and base all examples off of.
        due to length the examples can be found in Resume/Code/Example Code and in Resume/Code/Projects/Project 1 - Rosetta Stone/Example Code
